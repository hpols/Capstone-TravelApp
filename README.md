# Travel App Project

## Overview
This project is the capstone for the Udacity Front-End Developer nanodegree. It is an asynchronous web app that uses Web APIs to dynamically update the UI based on user input. 

## APIs used
* Geonames to get info on the destination
* Weatherbit to get weather info on the destination within the travel time
* Pixabay for displaying an image of the destination

## Extras
As per the project rubric we have to implement some extras. I have included:

* Add end date and display length of trip.
* Instead of just pulling a single day forecast, pull the forecast for multiple days.
* Incorporate icons into forecast.

## Running the Code
Download this repo (through git commands or directly as a zip) and navigate into the downloaded folder in your terminal.

* To run in development mode: call `npm run dev` from your terminal. Your browser will open to the localhost used.
* to run in production mode: call `npm run build` followed by `npm run start` from your terminal. Now you can start using the app in your browser.
